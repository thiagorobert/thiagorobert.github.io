## My first Robin Hood shot

It's been a while! ;)

A lot has happened since my last post, including a (brief?) pause on my adventures
in the space industry. But life moves on, and now I'm at a place where I feel
I want to start sharing tidbits about my life here again.

I've been thinking about what to post for a while, but last Friday I got my first
Robin Hood shot, and immediately realized I would be posting about that.

A “Robin Hood” shot in archery refers to the event when someone fires an arrow
directly into the back of an arrow that is already stuck in the target. I have
seen it happen right next to me a couple times, but had never got that shot.

Most Fridays I practice archery at the Archery Range in Golden Gate Park, which
is close to my house. These sessions often extend into the night, when the
lighted nocks come out and we enjoy shooting across the empty range. One of the
shots is roughly 140 yards to the target!

I was night-shooting by myself (for the first time), and started thinking about
the Robin Hood shot. I had one odd arrow, a new type I brought out to test.
I was always shooting that arrow last, but after a few rounds, a thought crossed
my mind: getting a Robin Hood shot on the back of that arrow. The very next round,
I shot it earlier, and when I went to retrieve my arrows, realized I had actually
got the shot I was envisioning. I felt I had willed the shot, which might not be
actually the case but it's still a good feeling.

Now to recoup my energies, and will my return to the space industry at some point soon!
