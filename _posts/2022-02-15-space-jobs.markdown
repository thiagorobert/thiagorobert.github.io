## Aggregator of job postings in the Space industry

TIL about Rocket Crew (<https://rocketcrew.space/>), which is an aggregator of
job postings in the Space Industry. I really like their slogan: *You don't need
to be an astronaut to work in the Space industry*. They also post new openings
on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RocketCrewSpace), so it's pretty easy to
passively keep an eye out.

As a side note, my own job in the Space industry started this week, so it might
be a bit difficult to continue to post regularly - but I'll do my best!
