## My other side project

Today I took the time to clean up and upload code/configs for my other
side project: [archerlog.com](http://archerlog.com). It's now available at
<https://github.com/thiagorobert/archerlog>.

archerlog.com started early in 2019 when a coworker told me about
[Secure Scuttlebutt](https://scuttlebutt.nz/) (SSB). This is someone I really
respect, so I gave the project an in-depth look despite the 90s styling of the
project's website and the fact that, at first glance, it looks like a very
complicated social networking app.

As I looked deeper, I became fascinated. Essentially, SSB is a decentralized
(decent) platform. The social network is simply an example application
implemented on top of that platform. This was my introduction to what is now
referred to as web3, but SSB truly emphasizes decentralization instead of the
cryptocurrency angle.

SSB's creator is [Dominic Tarr](https://twitter.com/dominictarr)
([github](https://github.com/dominictarr)). He's the author of over
[400 npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com/~dominictarr), a [DIY boat
enthusiast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMSmy7qF24q4f_y6L86zNMA), and 
someone that has once given a talk about software clad on a wizard's hat made
out of a [Doritos bag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giS-aIq0Kaw) ([this
interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27Iv8Jf4vZ0) is also worth linking to). 

I had a few interesting ideas for applications I could implement on top of SSB,
ranging from geocaching-style games to fully-encrypted content distribution
platforms with proof of ownership.

In January 2021, amidst the Covid-19 global pandemic, a friend invited me to
practice archery. I've always been interested in it, had practiced it a few
times before, and I literally live just a few blocks away from a free archery
range in Golden Gate Park. We started practicing weekly and roped in other friends.
It's been a great pandemic activity: outdoors, inherently physically distant, and
fun as hell.

I looked around for apps I could use to keep track of my progress in archery, and
didn't find any I really liked. That's when I decided to combine my passion for
archery and SSB with my desire to learn more about PWAs and AWS/Fargate. The
result is archerlog.com, which is honestly still pretty janky but has taught me
a TON about modern development.

I'm hoping to polish the app quite a bit more, fix all of the bugs, and use it
as a way to foster community amongst the bowmen that practice
at GGP's range.
