## Presentation about Serverless and GCP

Today I'm skiing at [Palisades Tahoe](https://www.palisadestahoe.com/)!
So I'll cheat and simply publish the most recent revision of a presentation
I've been rehashing since 2010. It's really relevant since
[yesterday](/2022/01/06/fargate.html) I mentioned
Serverless and talked a bit about GCP's offerings in that space.

Lo and behold: Containers, Docker, and Serverless GCP.
