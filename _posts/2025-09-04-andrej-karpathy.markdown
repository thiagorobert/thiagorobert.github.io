## The GOAT of ML

In my [last post](/2025/08/11/a-new-adventure.html) I mentioned [Zero to Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) by Andrej Karpathy. I just watched [Deep Dive into LLMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI) by him, where he does an excellent job of describing the three stages of model training: pre-training, post-training supervised fine-tuning, and post-training reinforcement learning.

I won't try to explain the contents, you should just go and watch the video. It's highly recommended! Here's a copy of the image Karpathy created using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) (my favorite diagramming tool for a while now) during the video.

Here are a couple of other interesting links I fished out of the video:

* [FineWeb](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceFW/blogpost-fineweb-v1), an alternative to the [OpenWeb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Skylion007/openwebtext) dataset I've used to train a model from scratch
* [TikTokenizer](https://tiktokenizer.vercel.app/), an incredible tool that translates text into the token vocabulary used by different models
* [LLMs visualizations](https://bbycroft.net/llm) by a kiwi software engineer
* [LM Arena](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard), a tool to rank (based on user votes) models across different tasks
* [Andrej Karpathy's website](https://karpathy.ai/)

Andrej Karpathy joins Moriba Jah and Dominic Tarr in the ranks of folks I found online somewhat randomly as I dove into personal projects. I came across Dominic when I started looking into [Secure Scuttlebut](https://ssbc.github.io/ssb-db/) (which I used when building [Archerlog](/2022/01/18/archerlog.html)) and decentralized applications/platforms. And Moriba is someone I came to look up to as I learned about [satellite tracking](/2022/01/03/satellite-tracking.html) and the players in the field, which include his company [Privateer](/2022/03/01/privateer.html). It's amazing to me that these folks are so generous with their knowledge and code - I can only hope some of the topics I've been spending my time on and chronicling in this blog are as useful to someone in the future.
