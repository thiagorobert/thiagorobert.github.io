## A new blog about Software, Space, Skiing, Archery, and more

### Why?

Why not? But if I had to rationalize it, I would pick:

*   I'm an aspiring author, I need to develop some routine around writing every day.
*   I'm doing some research on Satellite tracking and other space-related
software as preparation for a new gig at a startup, so I'll have content (and need to take notes).
*   Someone might actually learn something useful from it - I picture my daughter reading
through it one day and learning more about me.
*   It might be a good resource for folks with a background similar to mine
joining the Space Industry.
*   I sort of feel I don't have a voice/presence on the internet these days,
since I don't use social media - so this will be my voice!
*   I also want to publish some of the code I have laying around in my workspace, and
this will hopefully motivate me to actually do it.

### What?

Expect some rambling, and links to code.

### Who?

I have a blurb I had to write about myself a while back, for a work event.
So let's go with that: 

My full name is Thiago Robert Claudino dos Santos. I immigrated from Brazil to
the Bay Area in 2005. I’ve worked as a software engineer at Google for over 1/3
of my life, and also did time with Twitter (via Periscope’s acquisition) and
Motorola ([resume](http://thiago.pub)).

My hobbies include [archery](https://photos.app.goo.gl/z6zQR6pPCAELpb9j6),
[skiing/snowboarding](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7MHb8tXik&t=1m6s),
[traveling](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1NxYyDCK16PnSmAS9fKU91MbjUFA&usp=sharing),
and [photography](https://unsplash.com/@thiagorobert).
Fun fact, one of my life goals is to visit as many different countries as my
current age (I’m currently at 34 for 40, a lot of catching up to do).


### When?

Starting today, all through 2022, once a day! And hopefully this will be something
I would want to continue into the future.

### Where?

I'll probably host it on github pages (also considering medium).
The code will be at <https://github.com/thiagorobert> and I'll link
deployed applications out of <http://thiago.pub> (currently points to my resume).
