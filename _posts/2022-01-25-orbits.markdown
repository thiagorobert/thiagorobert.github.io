## Visualizing different types of orbits

I spent more time improving the [TLE tool I built](http://api.thiago.pub:8080/), and used
it to learn more about [Geocentric orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit).
I basically plugged in TLEs from [CelesTrack](https://celestrak.com/) into the
tool to generate images below. I also found this amazing SVG on Wikipedia, which
is a good overview. It's clickable, so you can use it to learn more about the
information depicted.

Most artificial satellites are in [Low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit),
including the ISS and Starlink constellation. The altitude of objects in this
orbit is never more than about one-third of the radius of Earth (roughly 2,000 km).

[Medium Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_Earth_orbit) encompasses
altitudes between 2,000 km and 35,786 km above sea level. The GPS constellation
is located in MEO, specifically in [Semi-synchronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-synchronous_orbit)
orbit, at an altitude of roughly 20,000 km.

Objects in [Geosynchronous orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit)
are at an altitude of 35,786 km and their period equals one sidereal day,
coinciding with Earth's rotation period.

Satellites in [High Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Earth_orbit)
have an altitude entirely above that of a Geosynchronous orbit. They appear to be
in retrograde motion, since their orbital period is greater than 24 hours.

A satellite in [Polar orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_orbit) 
passes above or nearly above Earth's poles on each revolution.

Satellites in [Molniya orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molniya_orbit) spend
most of their time over a designated area of the Earth. Molniya is a highly
elliptical orbit.

There's a lot more details on this, Wikipedia is an amazing resource as usual.
Links above are a great way to get started.
