## Play classics adventure games on your favorite platform

[ScummVM](https://www.scummvm.org/) is a program that makes it easy to play
classics like [Full Throttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Throttle_(1995_video_game))
and [The Secret of Monkey Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island)
on your favorite platform ([list](https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/)). I've been
meaning to write about it for a while, and since I stayed up way too late
playing Monkey Island last night, I decided it was time.

ScummVM isn't an emulator. It's a rewrite of engines that power games by
manufacturers like LucasArts, so game assets (images, videos, sounds, scripts)
can be reused, allowing these games to be played anywhere ScummVM can run.
ScummVM's name is derived from the first engine supported,
[SCUMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUMM) (which stands for "Script Creation
Utility for Maniac Mansion").

Note that you can't get the actual games from ScummVM's page, but they are pretty
easy to find (example: <https://cdromance.com/scummvm/>).

Just like [Sonic Pi](/2022/02/01/sonic-pi.html) and [Stellarium](/2022/01/03/satellite-tracking.html#stellarium),
ScummVM is an application I learned about while browsing Ubuntu Software. It's
pretty amazing to me how much learning and entertainment I harnessed from Open
Source Software I discovered there.
