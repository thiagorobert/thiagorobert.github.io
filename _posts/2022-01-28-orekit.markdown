## A low level space dynamics library

As I learn more about Space-related open source software, it becomes pretty clear
that [Orekit](https://www.orekit.org/) is the most established option. 

Orekit is a low level space dynamics library written in Java, with a
[Python wrapper](https://gitlab.orekit.org/orekit-labs/python-wrapper).
It was developed by [CS GROUP](https://www.csgroup.eu/en/), who also created
[ORaaS](https://oraas.orekit.space/), a REST API that provides Orekit-based
services like orbit determination.

Note that [AstriaGraph](http://astria.tacc.utexas.edu/AstriaGraph/) uses a custom
Python wrapper on top of Orekit named [`orbdetpy`](https://github.com/ut-astria/orbdetpy).

As I was looking at Orekit's examples, I found one that calculates the track
corridor for a satellite based on a TLE. Image below was generated using the
mple code](https://gitlab.orekit.org/orekit-labs/python-wrapper/-/blob/master/examples/Track_Corridor.ipynb),
and the TLE I retrieved from SpaceTrack a [while back](/2022/01/17/two-line-element-set.html).

This will make the perfect addition to the [TLE tool](http://api.thiago.pub:8080)
I created. I plan on updating it so it shows the track corridor for the input TLE,
alongside orbit visualization.
