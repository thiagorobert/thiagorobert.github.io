## I found 3 of my Glass devices today

I was recently thinking to myself, "I wish I had saved one of the many Glass
devices I owned, as a memento". Today, I retrieved an old box with personal items
from the Google SF office. To my surprise, I found 3 of my Glass devices inside,
including the one that was custom made for me, with lenses that match my
prescription!

Project Glass was one of the most interesting professional
experiences in my career. Over the course of roughly 3 years, software, hardware,
reliability, and manufacturing teams were assembled to breathe life into a new
class of consumer electronics (CE) device. I joined the effort as the 8th member
of the software team, which had grown to 75 engineers by the time I transitioned
out of the project after the launch of Glass V1. During that time I had the chance
to contribute to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7TB8b2t3QE">best live demo of all times</a>,
the launch of a developer API and SDK, and building an epic marketing campaign
for the product. I also had the chance to learn valuable insights on CE manufacturing,
marketing, and probably more than I wished to know about CE batteries.

The device that was custom made for me is the most recent in terms of hardware and
manufacturing, so it's the one I'm hoping I'll be able to boot up.

I'm charging it up now. If I can do anything interesting with it, you bet I'll
be writing about it here!
