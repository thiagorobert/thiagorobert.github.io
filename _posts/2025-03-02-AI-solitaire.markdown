## solitAIre - a fully functioning Solitaire game implemented using 30 prompts

I made a solitAIre game using [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/). Check it out: https://v0.dev/chat/solitaire-game-B6BdOCKTGH1?b=b_gGPzRx1dFk4&f=0

That link above lets you see the 30 prompts I used to generate the game, along with the output after each prompt.

This is the deployed version (in [vercel](https://vercel.com/)): https://v0-solitaire-game-w1srkj.vercel.app/

The best part of all of this is that I learned about these tools from this funny video about a developer trying to use AI: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/64TNGvCoegE . These guys are pretty funny (and also informative!), I recommend checking out their videos. I still need to check out [replit](https://replit.com) and [cursor](https://www.cursor.com), the other tools mentioned in the video.
