## Teaching my daughter how to ski

Today I spent a good chunk of my day at Palisades teaching my daughter Sienna how to ski.
It was her second day out skiing, we did a few practice runs at [Diamond Peak](https://www.diamondpeak.com/) yesterday.
Overall, she had a lot of fun and did really well! I'm a proud dad, and really hope she grows
up enjoying skiing at least as much as I do.

And she was also fearless on the sled (at [Granlibakken](https://sledding.granlibakken.com/))!

Tomorrow we'll probably make it to [Soda Springs](https://skisodasprings.com) in the morning. So after this week, Sienna will have skied or sled in 4 out of 15 ski resorts in Tahoe (I was just looking at [this list](https://www.skiresort.info/ski-resorts/lake-tahoe/)). I also just realized that after having visited Granlibakken and Diamond Peak this week, I have now checked all 15 Tahoe resorts!
