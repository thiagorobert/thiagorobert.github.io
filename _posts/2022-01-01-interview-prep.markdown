## Solutions to questions from Cracking the Coding Interview 

I purchased [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)
(Fifth Edition) a while back. I had
solved some of the questions earlier in 2021, but really spent some quality time
with it in preparation for my interviews with LeoLabs.

I just made the code I created while solving questions from the book available
at <https://github.com/thiagorobert/interviewprep>. Note that most of the code is in Python,
since that's the main language LeoLabs uses, and what I wanted to brush up on.

I hope this is useful to someone else!
