## `space-client-js` is now a public NPM package

I'm really impressed about how easy it was to [adopt OpenApi](/2022/01/23/openapi.html)
and use it to automatically generate a Javascript REST client. Today I published
that code as a new NPM package: `space-client-js`
(see <https://www.npmjs.com/package/space-client-js>). That process was also
very straightforward. I had to modify the code generated by `openapi-generator-cli`
a little bit, to adjust the package name
([`ee2767e`](https://github.com/thiagorobert/space-client-js/commit/ee2767efeba76f01f1ecd77c526ca9412ac2347f)).
After that, it was a matter of creating a NPM account, logging in (`npm login`)
and publishing the new module (`npm publish`).

Installing the new package and adopting it on the [UI](/2022/01/21/functional-ui.html)
was painless and drastically simplified the code
([`1e05b3`](https://github.com/thiagorobert/space-api/commit/1e05b39b631b1778cea36a1821552fef6898073c)).
I've dealt with a lot of software complexity over the years, so I was expecting
a lot more fiery hoops to jump through in order to make this work. It was an
extremely pleasant surprise that it all went so smoothly.
