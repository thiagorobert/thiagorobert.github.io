## A reference guide to modern space activities

I haven't been posting regularly, but today is my birthday so I had to post *something*!

I recently learned about [Space Foundation](https://www.spacefoundation.org/) via
this resource: **A reference guide to modern space activities**.

      <div>No online PDF viewer installed</div>
  </object>

It gives a pretty good high-level overview of several topics I've been covering
in this blog: Space Program around the world, space policy/regulation, types of
orbits, SSA, launch systems, and more. Check out above for the copy I'm hosting
with this blog, or [download it from Space Foundation's website](https://spacefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SpaceFoundation_Space101.pdf)!
