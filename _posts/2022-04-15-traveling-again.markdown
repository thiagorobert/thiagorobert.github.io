## After 2 years

The family and I are getting ready to go on a trip tomorrow. We are flying out to Florida for Easter with Jennifer's family, then Costa Rica for 5 days, back to Florida to celebrate Sienna's birthday with family in Orlando and take her to Disney, and then to Ft. Meyers Beach, FL to see friends. Try to say all of that in one breath.

It's amazing to be traveling again - finally! - after almost 2 years without it.
