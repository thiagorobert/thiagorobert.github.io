## I just deployed this blog using GitHub Pages and Jekyll

It works! It was actually pretty smooth. Even using a custom domain was
relatively straightforward, I have it deployed at [blog.thiago.pub](http://blog.thiago.pub).

It needs a bit more polishing, but it's pretty impressive how easy these things are these days.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) is a static site generator. I didn't know about it,
but [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) documentation recommends it to create blogs on top of the platform.
It's implemented in Ruby, and it was interesting to look into that again and learn about
[RubyGems](https://guides.rubygems.org/what-is-a-gem/) (I think of it as something akin to NPM, but for Ruby).
