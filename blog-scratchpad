Tl;Dr: Scrapping it!


# 2022-01-05

Tl;Dr: How far are you from Mars?


# 2022-01-04

Tl;Dr: Streaming RPCs.


# 2022-01-03

Tl;Dr: Dockerfile for yesterday's code, it's now deployed at
<http://api.thiago.pub> using AWS Fargate.


# 2022-01-02

Tl;Dr: How I found out about LeoLabs, Celestrak, Space-Track, AstriaGraph and more. 
Mention and Stellarium.

Tl;Dr: Code drop! Python gRPC server, a Go proxy providing a REST API for
that server, and the aut-generated OpenAPI Document.

Tl;Dr: [Code drop](https://github.com/thiagorobert/interviewprep)! My solutions
to interview questions from Cracking the Coding Interview. 

I purchased [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)
(Fifth Edition) a while back. I had
solved some of the questions earlier in 2021, but really spent some quality time
with it in preparation for my interviews with LeoLabs.

I just made the code I created while solving questions from the book available
at <https://github.com/thiagorobert/interviewprep>. Note that most of the code is in Python,
since that's the main language LeoLabs uses, and what I wanted to brush up on.

I hope this is useful to someone else!

Tl;Dr: I accepted an offer from LeoLabs!

Yup, it just happened. It was a great way to close out 2021. I've been
thinking about working in the space industry for a while now, at least
since 2017. I actually talked to folks at Planet in 2017, when I was
leaving Twitter, but it wasn't the right place or the right time.

Now, it's happening! LeoLabs has created a network of radars to monitor
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and provides its customers with data they can use
to manuver their satellites and avoid collisions in orbit.

I first learned about LeoLabs on Nov 4th, 2021; there was a blurb on my dialy
netwletter that caught my eye:

"Space sure is crowded: Check out this [visualization](https://platform.leolabs.space/visualization)
of all the debris, satellites, and other objects floating in low-Earth orbit."

I explored the visulization, the company's website and offerings, and their jobs
page. I saw a position open for remote Senior Software Engineer to work on their APIs.
I got excited, immediately updated my resume, and applied that same day. I also started
practicing for the interview process.

That's how things went down from there:

*   On Nov 9th LeoLabs recruiter contacted me about my application.

*   On Nov 17th I had a conversation with the hiring manager, the person running
platforms at LeoLabs.

*   I had interviews with engineers on Dec 10th, and 16th; On the 17th I spoke with their Product Manager.

*   On Dec 27th, I got a verbal offer; on the 29th I had the chance to speak with LeoLabs CFO, and on the last day of the year, I verbally accepted the offer!

I'll talk more about LeoLabs in the future, today I just wanted to register
how things went down in terms of getting a job there.

Tl;Dr: I'm Thiago, I decied to write every day in 2022, so I'm creating
a blog about things I care about: Software, Space, Skiing, Archery,
and my family. Should be fun!

## Why?

Why not? But if I had to rationalize it, I would pick:

*   I'm an aspiring author, I need to develop some routine around writing.
*   I'm doing some research on Satellite tracking and other space-related
software as preperation for a new gig at a startup, so I'll have content (and need notes).
*   Someone my actually learn something from this - I picture my daughter reading
thorugh it one day and learning something useful, and more about myself.
*   Maybe it will be a good resource for folks with a similar background
joining the startup in the future.
*   I sort of feel I don't have a voice/presence on the internet these days,
since I don't use social media - so this will be my voice!
*   I also want to publish some of the code I have laying around in my workspace, and
this will hopefully motivate me to actually do it.

## What?

Expect some rambling, and link to code.

## Who?

I have a blurb I had to write about myself a while back, for a work event.
So let's go with that: 

My full name is Thiago Robert Claudino dos Santos. I immigrated from Brazil to
the Bay Area in 2005. I’ve worked as a software engineer at Google for over 1/3
of my life, and also did time with Twitter (via Periscope’s acquisition) and
Motorola ([resume](http://thiago.pub)).

My hobbies include [archery](https://photos.app.goo.gl/z6zQR6pPCAELpb9j6),
[skiing/snowboarding](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej7MHb8tXik&t=1m6s),
[traveling](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1NxYyDCK16PnSmAS9fKU91MbjUFA&usp=sharing),
and [photography](https://unsplash.com/@thiagorobert).
Fun fact, one of my life goals is to visit as many different countries as my
current age (I’m currently at 34 for 40, a lot of catching up to do).


# When?

Starting today, all through 2022, once a day! And hopefully this will be something
I would want to continue into the future.

# Where?

I'll probably host it on github pages (also considering medium).
The code will be at <https://github.com/thiagorobert> and I'll link
deployed applications out of <http://thiago.pub> (currently points to my resume).
